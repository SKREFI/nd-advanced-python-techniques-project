Bugs and Fixes I had so far:

- comparing is_hazard field of the NEO with True/False will always return False
  Sol: As everything is a string, I had to compare with str of True/False
   
   - This leeds to some other bug in `my_main.py` where I am debuggin code, converting to boolean in the NEO Constructor
     comparing `is_hazard` field with some value of True or False I had problems, it will return only True values
     latter on, I realized that bool("False") will return a True so I had to make an explicit `if` in the Constructor

        - Plot twist once again, using boolean, it will fail filtering in Filter.apply
          So I am coming back to everything as str as it is lot easyer to deal with

                - At the root, it's the same reason I encounter bugs
                  you must compare floats to get good results of speed diameter etc

- You guys provided some arguments for the writer, and called it using some others, made a special argument for data output mode
  and ended up sending output file to format, I don't even know, I just have to change it a bit when calling the write functions

- Made it work in my_main.py, but not in the terminal, spent 2 hours debuggin to find out I have typed one more 0 for the filter
  therefor no NEO found
